Box-  Microblogging and problem solving site

We have observed that all of us face lots of problems in university of various kinds viz 
Academic, Co-curricular, Management Related Or regarding Announcements, etc. Both 
Administration as well as students need a common platform catering specially these kinds 
of issues that are of different scale. 
So we came up with an idea to develop a platform which can bridge the gap between the 
person having a query/ problem to the person who can provide its solution.
It will help develop different field focused communities for sustainable growth and 
guidance, which is not only limited to academics.
